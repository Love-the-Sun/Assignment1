difficulties in memory, language, and behaviour that leads to
impairments in activities of daily living. Alzheimer’s disease
is the most common subtype of dementia, followed by vascular
dementia, mixed dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies.
Because the global population is rapidly ageing, dementia has
become a concern worldwide1; the illness places considerable
burden on individuals and their families and also on health and
social care provision.
By 2050 an estimated 135 million people worldwide will have
dementia. In 2010 the global cost of dementia care was estimated
at $604bn (£396bn; €548bn) and estimated to increase to $1tr
by 2030.1 Of all chronic diseases, dementia is one of the most
important contributors to dependence and disability.2 3 In the
absence of a cure, a professional belief that nothing can be done
has contributed to delays in diagnosis.4 However, increasing
evidence showing that dementia may be preventable1 5 has led
to an international focus on earlier diagnosis and intervention.6
This review aims to summarise current evidence and best
practice in the diagnosis and early intervention in dementia care.
Why is timely diagnosis important?
In some countries the introduction of a national dementia
strategy has led to greater emphasis on earlier diagnosis,
although population based screening is not recommended as
dementia does not fulfil the criteria of a condition suitable for
screening.7 With evidence from large longitudinal cohort studies
showing that the prevalence of dementia is declining globally,
there is now greater emphasis on prevention and risk reduction.1 5
In England, policy has rightly or wrongly influenced the
introduction of case finding in high risk groups—including
people over 75 years of age, as age is the strongest risk factor
for dementia—and those with high vascular risk, Parkinson’s
disease, and learning disabilities.8 The policy comprises
proactive memory assessment of people in both primary care
and acute hospital settings who may not have symptoms;
however, there is little evidence that such initiatives, which
inevitably lead to increased referrals to specialist services, are
cost effective and whether they are distressing to patients.4 6
How can clinicians recognise dementia?
Diagnosing dementia can be difficult owing to its insidious
onset, symptoms resembling “normal ageing” memory loss, and
a diversity of other presenting symptoms—for example,
difficulty in finding words or making decisions.10 An
individual’s ability to accommodate, compensate, or even deny
his or her symptoms in the early stages should also be
considered. The individual’s family may also have noticed
difficulties in communication and personality or mood changes;
family concern is of particular importance.9 Increasing frequency
of patients’ visits to their general practice, missed appointments,
or confusion over drugs may also be warning signs.8
Diagnosis of subtype is important given differences in
management, disease course, and outcomes for different
dementias; awareness of early symptoms in less common
dementias can assist generalists in deciding to which specialist
services patients are referred (box 1). Duration over which
symptoms have developed is also important, with Alzheimer’s
disease tending to have a more insidious onset than vascular
dementia.
How is dementia diagnosed?
The role of primary care
General practitioners are often the first point of contact for
patients who are worried that they may have dementia. The role
of primary care is to exclude a potentially treatable illness or
reversible cause of the “dementia”—for example, depression,
vitamin B12 deficiency, or thyroid disturbance; refer for specialist
assessment, especially those with unusual symptoms
(neurological, psychiatric, or behavioural changes) or those with
major risk factors (for example, important medical
comorbidities, psychosocial problems, harm to self); and ensure
patients who have mild cognitive impairment (objective
cognitive loss not affecting function and daily living activities)
are followed up in primary care, and, if their symptoms become
more severe, re-referred for specialist assessment.
Initial assessment should include a careful history from both
the patient and the main carer, with particular emphasis on
disturbance of cognitive function and activities of daily living.
A physical examination should be undertaken to look for any
focal neurological signs and exclude any visual or auditory
problems. Baseline investigations and a brief cognitive
assessment, using one of the many tools available (box 2),
should also be carried out before referral to secondary care.9
The mini-mental state examination16 has traditionally been
recommended as the brief cognitive assessment tool of choice,
although copyright restrictions are influencing its use in practice.
The tools listed in box 2 have been found to be as clinically and
psychometrically robust as the mini-mental state examination17;
a clock drawing test may be added to the assessment if it is not
already incorporated into the tool.18 The Addenbrooke’s
cognitive examination,19 especially the revised version, has
superior diagnostic accuracy to the mini-mental state
examination but takes about 25 minutes to complete and has
better accuracy in moderate to high prevalence settings.20 No
one brief cognitive assessment tool is more accurate than another
and all are inadequate for assessing early or subtle changes,
with scores affected by factors such as education. Mini-mental
state examination scores are used to indicate the severity of
Alzheimer’s disease: mild, scores 21-26; moderate, scores 10-20;
moderately severe, scores 10-14; severe, scores less than 10.
Depression masquerading as dementia is probably the most
common differential diagnosis and should always be considered;
however, they can coexist and depression may precede dementia.
If suspected, a trial of antidepressants may be indicated, with
reassessment of the individual’s capabilities and cognitive
function 6-8 weeks later.
The role of secondary care
Primary care is increasingly taking on a greater role in both the
assessment and the long term care of people with dementia; one
multicentre randomised controlled trial found no evidence that
specialist memory clinics were more effective than general
practice services in providing post-diagnostic support.21
Secondary services have an important role in defining the
dementia subtype, dealing with more complex cases, and
stratifying which patients with mild cognitive impairment are
at greatest risk of developing dementia and most in need of
follow-up.
What are the roles of imaging and other
investigations?
Imaging, in particular structural scanning (computed tomography
or magnetic resonance imaging), is recommended as part of the
investigations of people with suspected dementia in UK,9
European,22 and US guidelines.23 Imaging is now also embedded
in several modern diagnostic criteria for different dementias,
including Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy
bodies.24-26 In modern dementia imaging there is now less focus
on “excluding” reversible causes of dementia (for example,
tumours) and more on determination of subtype. Structural
imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, can also help
clarify whether a vascular disease is contributing to the cognitive
impairment and thus whether strict adherence to treatment
guidance for vascular risks is warranted.
In the United Kingdom, functional neuroimaging, including
hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) and
[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET), is available but usually used as a second line
approach to assist with subtype diagnoses, particularly where
the diagnosis is in doubt. Dopaminergic iodine-123-radiolabelled
2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)
nortropane (FP-CIT) SPECT imaging is licensed in Europe and
in a number of other countries for the diagnosis of dementia
with Lewy bodies and may also be helpful where the clinical
diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is not clear.27
What new investigations are emerging in
the diagnosis of dementia?
Cerebrospinal fluid sampling is used to exclude inflammatory,
infective, and malignancy related causes of dementia and is
typically recommended in individuals with rapid cognitive
decline, unusual or neurological presentations, or cognitive
impairment at less than 55 years of age.28 More recently there
has been a focus on developing cerebrospinal fluid based
markers, such as β amyloid and tau, for changes in Alzheimer’s
disease that can predate the onset of the dementia, the so called
prodromal phase of Alzheimer’s disease. Although such markers
have been incorporated into recent diagnostic criteria for
Alzheimer’s disease,25 26 whether they are effective at predicting
those who will develop dementia29 and, more importantly,
practically acceptable, makes their widespread clinical use
challenging at present.
It is now possible to directly image amyloid in the brain using
several positron emission tomography radiotracers, and this
imaging technique may have a future role clinically in predicting
which people with mild cognitive impairment will develop
Alzheimer’s disease. However there is still major heterogeneity
in how these scans are interpreted. For example, a recent
meta-analysis found that although amyloid imaging has high
sensitivity (83-100%) in detecting people with mild cognitive
impairment who convert to Alzheimer’s disease related
dementia, diagnostic specificities varied considerably between
studies (46-88%).30
What constitutes best practice in early
intervention?
Discussing the diagnosis: saying the “D”
word
Health professionals can be reluctant to speak openly and
honestly with patients and their families about dementia, with
some refraining from using the “D” word.28 Although initially
discussing the diagnosis may be distressing, evidence suggests
most people prefer to know if they have dementia in order to
access appropriate support and treatment and to plan for the
future.4 31
What options are available after
diagnosis?
Drug interventions
Clinically and cost effective drugs for dementia are available;
the emphasis is to improve or maintain function after neuronal
damage rather than to alter the underlying pathogenesis leading
to the dementia syndrome. Two classes of drugs are currently
recommended for symptomatic (Alzheimer’s disease and mixed)
dementia6 32: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil,
galantamine, and rivastigmine, and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
receptor antagonists such as memantine. At present,
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the only recommended
options to manage mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease and
there is no evidence that one is more efficacious than another33;
notwithstanding, a large randomised controlled trial has recently
shown that continued treatment with donepezil is associated
with cognitive benefits in moderate to severe dementia.34
Memantine has been approved for people with moderate to
severe Alzheimer’s disease or those with intolerance to
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; it has also been used in mild
Alzheimer’s disease but the evidence for this is currently lacking
despite its frequent off-label use.35
Non-drug approaches
The evidence base is steadily increasing for non-drug
interventions in dementia care, although further research in
many areas is still needed.6 In a large systematic review
evaluating both drug and non-drug interventions in dementia
care, cognitive stimulation therapy was found to be as clinically
and cost effective as the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors36;
reminiscence therapy is also recommended in national
guidelines.9 However, the evidence base for innovative service
provision such as case management, whereby a case manager,
usually a nurse or social worker acts as the main care coordinator
between key stakeholders, including primary and secondary
care, is mixed.6 36 Although the evidence base for cost
effectiveness is low,37 specially developed assistive
technology—any device or system that allows an individual to
perform tasks that they would otherwise be unable to do, or
increases the ease and safety with which the task can be
performed—to help people with dementia is available and can
be useful in relieving carer anxiety and helping people with
dementia to remain living at home (www.atdementia.org.uk/).
Information provision
People with dementia and their families require emotional and
practical support to help them live as good a quality of life as
they can; the family doctor is in a key position to provide
ongoing support and advice once the diagnosis is confirmed.4 6
Voluntary organisations such as Alzheimer’s International
provide a wide range of information resources and practical
support for people living with all types of dementia (www.alz.
co.uk/). Signposting to local sources of support as well as social
services and respite care are integral to the consultation.
Listening to an individual patient’s difficulties and concerns
and providing simple cognitive and emotional strategies in the
primary care consultation are beneficial to both patients and
their families.
Discussing the future
One important area to be discussed in the earlier stages of
dementia, while people still have mental capacity, is personal
wishes for future care and also who should make decisions when
the patients are no longer able to do so. In dementia, such
discussions—termed advance care planning—have been shown
to reduce inappropriate hospital admissions towards the end of
life, but the evidence base is weak.38 39 Discussions about
advance care planning require both sensitivity and honesty;
general practitioners or hospital specialists are well placed to
undertake these discussions if they have an established
relationship with the patient. After such conversations, patients
can formally record their wishes in several ways, including the
completion of an advance directive, or “living will” as it was
previously known (box 3).
Primary care doctors may find it difficult to assess the mental
capacity of an individual with dementia; mental capacity may
fluctuate with time and also with acute illness. In England, the
introduction of the Mental Capacity Act in 2005 provided much
needed guidance for health and social care professionals on how
to undertake an assessment of capacity and to make decisions
in the best interests of adults who lack the mental capacity to
do so for themselves (box 4).
Caring for family carers
In the UK, two thirds of people with dementia live independently
in the community, with most of their care and support provided
by family and friends. Such informal carers are more likely to
experience depressed mood, to report a higher care “burden,”
and to have worse physical health than carers of people with
other long term conditions.40 They may grieve as their family
member loses functional and cognitive abilities, and as
companionship, affection, and intimacy are affected; this is
termed a living bereavement. Notwithstanding the satisfaction
carers experience from caring, the support they receive and their
ability to seek help when needed influence how they cope.
Supporting informal carers, monitoring their health and
wellbeing, and providing or referring them for additional
practical and psychological support is another crucial role for
general practitioners and community care services.41
