Abstract
Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) progenies hold great promise as surrogates for human primary cells, particularly if the
latter are not available as in the case of cardiomyocytes. However, high content experimental platforms are lacking that
allow the function of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes to be studied under relatively physiological and standardized
conditions. Here we describe a simple and robust protocol for the generation of fibrin-based human engineered heart tissue
(hEHT) in a 24-well format using an unselected population of differentiated human embryonic stem cells containing 30–40%
a-actinin-positive cardiac myocytes. Human EHTs started to show coherent contractions 5–10 days after casting, reached
regular (mean 0.5 Hz) and strong (mean 100 mN) contractions for up to 8 weeks. They displayed a dense network of
longitudinally oriented, interconnected and cross-striated cardiomyocytes. Spontaneous hEHT contractions were analyzed
by automated video-optical recording and showed chronotropic responses to calcium and the b-adrenergic agonist
isoprenaline. The proarrhythmic compounds E-4031, quinidine, procainamide, cisapride, and sertindole exerted robust,
concentration-dependent and reversible decreases in relaxation velocity and irregular beating at concentrations that
recapitulate findings in hERG channel assays. In conclusion this study establishes hEHT as a simple in vitro model for heart
research.

Introduction
Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are pluripotent cells and
can differentiate into all cell types of the body. Progenies of hESCs
could become very useful tools for drug development, toxicology
and therapeutic applications. Among hESC derivatives cardiomyocytes
are of particular interest since electrophysiological properties
of cardiomyocytes from laboratory animals such as mice, rats
and swine are substantially different from human cardiomyocytes,
limiting the validity of the obtained results. Despite the theoretical
advantages, the use of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes is still
hampered by inefficient differentiation, poor levels of maturation
and the lack of experimental systems that would allow measurements
of contractile function under defined conditions.
Cardiac differentiation of hESCs was achieved by undirected
differentiation in serum containing media yielding 8% of beating
embryoid bodies (EBs) [1]. Protocols relying on directed
differentiation strategies resulted in higher cardiomyocytes yield.
These include EB-based differentiation by growth factor cocktails
mimicking early embryonic development, paracrine effects of
END-2 cells via co-culture, conditioned media or a derived
chemically defined media or the differentiation of confluent layers
of hESCs by activin A and BMP4 under serum-free conditions
[2–6]. Cardiomyocytes derived from these protocols appeared
morphologically and functionally immature. Histologically, cardiomyocytes
presented as polygonal to round cells with uneven cellular
distribution of sarcomeres. Sarcomeric organisation of myofibrils
was present predominantly in the perinuclear zone, but not in the
periphery of the cell. Cellular alignment and uniform orientation
were lacking. The immature histological phenotype was supported
by electrophysiological characteristics. Action potential amplitude,
maximal diastolic potential, upstroke velocity and duration suggested
that hESC-derived cardiomyocytes resemble cardiomyocytes from
16 week old fetal hearts [3]. Previous strategies on the generation of
hESC-CM based myocardial tissue engineering included the
generation of matrix-based [7] as well as scaffold-free protocols
[8,9]. These protocols resulted in cardiac patches with a network of
cardiomyocytes. The implementation of mechanical load resulted in
improved alignment and maturation of cardiomyocytes and was
accompanied with better survival after transplantation [10].
Torsades de pointes tachycardia (TdP) and ventricular tachycardia
(VT) are frequent presentations of proarrhythmic side effects of
various drugs. An important precondition for these tachycardias is
prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG. This drug induced long
QT Syndrome (LQT) develops when delayed rectifier potassium
currents are inhibited. Delayed rectifier potassium currents are
subdivided into a rapid (IKr) and a slow component (IKs). In human
cardiomyocytes IKr is the predominant form and hERG channels
contribute substantially to this current. Many proarrhythmic drugs
block hERG channels. Preclinical cardiac toxicity test panels
typically include measurements of hERG channel activity in
HEK293 cells, action potential duration in dog or rabbit Purkinje
fibers and QTc interval and rhythm in instrumented dogs. These
tests are recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), but remain
partially insufficient because they are based either on noncardiomyocytes
or non-human cells, are difficult to standardize or
unsuitable for large scale screening purposes [11,12]. The problem is
relevant since several approved drugs had to be withdrawn from the
market because proarrhythmic side effects were recognized only in
clinical use. Microelectrode arrays (MEA) have been proposed as a
format for hESC-derived cardiomyocytes based toxicity tests, a
technique which relies on the concept that beating clusters of
cardiomyocytes generate external field potentials. Field potential
durations are directly linked to action potential durations and are
easy to define and measure [13]. HESC-derived cardiomyocytes
displayed broadened field potentials in the presence of proarrhythmic
compounds in a concentration-dependent manner [14,13]. IC50
values in MEA were discrepant to findings in hERG channel assays,
possibly due to cellular immaturity and technical limitations.
Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) are three dimensional forcegenerating
cardiac tissue-like structures. EHTs from neonatal rat
hearts develop a high degree of cellular differentiation, longitudinal
orientation, intercellular coupling and force generation
[15,16]. The principal usefulness of these techniques for in vitro
testing [17,18] and cardiac repair [19] has been demonstrated.
Miniaturisation and automation has been accomplished with stripformat
fibrin-based mini-EHTs. This format proved suitable to
detect proarrhythmic effects of drugs in neonatal rat heart EHT
[20]. The present study aimed at establishing a robust protocol for
the generation of hESC-derived EHT and determining its validity
in detecting effects of proarrhythmic compounds.
Results
Cardiomyocyte differentiation and EHT generation
Cardiomyocyte differentiation was performed with a modified
EB-based, three-stage, growth factor cocktail protocol [2]. Modifications
of the published protocol included the expansion of hESCs
(hES2) on MatrigelH with conditioned medium, allowing formation
of EBs without feeder depletion (Figure 1). EB formation was
performed in conditioned medium. Differentiation was induced in
RPMI/B27 in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632
(10 mM) and HEPES (10 mM) (see Figure S1). The duration
of mesodermal induction by BMP-4, activin-A and basic FGF
had impact on cardiomyocyte differentiation. The optimal duration
appeared to depend on the quality of input hESCs which can not be
monitored in real time. In our hands insufficient differentiation
outcomes were improved after readjusting the duration of
mesodermal induction (24–72 hours). Onset of beating occurred
between day 10 and day 15. The number of beating EBs increased
after transfer to serum-containing media and switch to 20% oxygen
and reached 60–90% (Movie S1). A 100 cm2 culture of undifferentiated
hESCs (,156106) resulted in approximately 1.56106
differentiated cells out of which 41610% (n=3) stained positive for
a-actinin in FACS analysis (Figure 2F).
Differentiated EBs were enzymatically dispersed. The dissociated
cells were mixed with fibrinogen and thrombin and poured
into slit-formed agarose casting molds in a standard 24-well plate
in which two elastic silicone posts per well were inserted from
above (600,000 cells/EHT; Figure 1D, E). After fibrin polymerisation
(2 hours) silicone racks with 4 pairs of silicone posts each
and the respective cell-fibrin gel were transferred to new 24 well
plates and maintained under standard cell culture conditions for
two weeks (Figure 1F). Onset of coherent, silicone post-deflecting
beating activity occurred on day 5–10. Contractile EHTs were
subjected to automated video-optical recording and analysis
between day 15–55 (Figure 1G–I). Human EHTs (hEHT) showed
stable values for force, frequency, contraction and relaxation
velocity for several weeks (Figure 1J) allowing for repeated
measurements after washout. The spontaneous beating pattern
was regular with frequencies ranging from 40–70 beats per minute
and average force development of 0.06160.013 mN (n =4). Based
on the simplifying assumption that the EHTs are circular cylinders
and a mean diameter of 0.72 mm this is equivalent to 0.12 mN/
mm2 (Movie S2, information S1).

Transcript analysis
Cardiac differentiation was monitored by analyzing transcript
levels of marker genes. The stemness marker POU class 5
homeobox 1 (POU5F1, OCT4) showed highest expression in
undifferentiated hESCs and a sharp decline in mRNA levels upon
differentiation. The mesodermal markers brachyury homolog (T),
mesoderm posterior 1 homolog (MESP1), vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor 2 (KDR) and platelet derived growth factor
receptor alpha (PDGFRA) were significantly upregulated at early
time points of differentiation (d2–d4) and remained significantly
upregulated (KDR) or declined again (T, MESP1, PDGFRA). Islet-1
(ISL1) a progenitor marker of the development of the secondary
heart field [21] was significantly upregulated on day 6 and 8.
Transcripts of the cardiac markers a-myosin heavy chain (a-
MHC, MYH6, fast isoform) and ß-myosin heavy chain (ß-MHC,
MYH7, slow isoform) were essentially absent on day 2 of the
differentiation protocol and dramatically increased between day 4
and 8. Comparison of the level of upregulation on day 8 revealed
that a-myosin heavy chain (10,000-fold upregulation) was the
dominant form and ß-myosin heavy chain expression (500-fold)
substantially lower (Figure 3A–H).
To evaluate whether the EHT format had an effect on
cardiomyocyte maturation when compared to the standard EB
format, cardiac markers were analyzed in 2–3 week old EBs, 7–8
week old EBs and hEHTs that had been cultured for 5 weeks after
having been generated from 2–3 week old EBs (to age-match 7–8
week old EBs). This analysis (n= 4–6 independent experiments)
revealed that alpha actin (ACTC1), sodium/calcium exchanger,
(SLC8A1), slow skeletal troponin (TNNI1), troponin I Type 3
(TNNI3), troponin T (TNNT2), and a-MHC transcript levels did
not differ between the different culture formats, while ß-MHC
expression was upregulated two- to threefold stronger in the EHT
format. The mRNA levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (NPPA) also
tended to be higher in EHTs, but the difference did not reach
significance (Figure 3I–P).
To determine the character of the non-myocyte cell population
transcript concentrations were analyzed in 2–3 and 7–8 week old
EBs as well as 5 week old EHTs (n=4–5 independent experiments)
by quantitative PCR with primers for neuroectodermal (NEUROD1,
neurogenic differentiation 1; SOX1 sex determining region Y-box 1),
endodermal (FOXA2, forkhead box A2; FOXA3, forkhead box A3),
hematopoietic (PTPRC, CD45, protein tyrosine phosphatase,
receptor type, C; GATA1 globin transcription factor 1), endothelial
(CDH5, VE-cadherin; PECAM1, CD31, platelet/endothelial cell
adhesion molecule), mesodermal somite (MEOX1, mesenchyme
homeobox 1) and (myo)fibroblast (CNN1, calponin; ACTA2, smooth
muscle actin) development (Figure S2) [2]. CD45 and GATA1 were
undetectable in all samples. CNN1, CDH5, PECAM1, FOXA2 and
NEUROD1 were expressed at low levels (,10-fold of undifferentiated
hESC) and showed no significant differences between the three
groups (Figure S2). ACTA2 was.100-fold upregulated in 2–3 weekold
EB compared to undifferentiated hESC, and this increase
continued with time of cultivation and even more so in the EHT
format, reaching ,600-fold. MEOX1 and SOX1 showed essentially
a mirrored pattern with relative high levels in 2–3 week-old EBs
(.10-fold undifferentiated hESC), a decline over time and lowest
levels in EHTs (Figure S2). FOXA3 was expressed at very low levels
(,0.5 fold undifferentiated hESC), which further decreased
significantly in the EHT format.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence staining of EBs revealed a-actinin-positive
cells with partial sarcomeric organisation (Figure 2A). Cardiomyocytes
showed random orientation and poor alignment. In
contrast, cardiomyocytes in EHT showed enhanced alignment
and predominant longitudinal orientation along force lines
(Figure 2B). Quantification by blinded angle dispersion analysis
revealed significantly higher alignment in EHTs (Figure 2E,
*P,0.05, Student’s t-test). Sarcomeric organisation was evenly
distributed and well developed, both around the nuclei and the
periphery of the cells. Cardiomyocytes showed expression of
connexin-43, but not confined to intercalated disks as in the adult
heart (Figure 2D). This pattern is similar to connexin-43
expression in rat EHT [20]. EHT also contained a-actininnegative
cells reflecting the mixed population of input cells.
Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin, which identified a
subpopulation of these along the surface of the EHT, indicates that
they are fibroblast-like cells (Figure 2C).
Electrophysiology
To compare electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes
in the EB format and inside hEHT, cells were dissociated by
mechanical means and impaled by sharp electrodes. All hESCderived
cardiomyocytes displayed spontaneous action potentials
(AP) synchronous to their contractions. Basic AP parameters of
hESC-derived cardiomyocyte cultures at different stages and
culture conditions, respectively, are summarized in Table 1. Cells
exhibited discontinuous AP firing patterns with frequencies
ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 Hz in EBs and 0.08 to 0.7 Hz in EHTs.
Higher firing rates were accompanied by shorter AP durations
(APD). Overall, cardiomyocyte APs fulfilled the criteria adopted
for classification as primitive or nodal-like [22]. 7–8 week old EBs
featured higher APD80 and upstroke velocity than 2–3 week-old
EBs, which argues for increasing maturation of hESC over time
(Figure 2G–I, Figure S3). Mean APD80 of cardiomyocytes isolated
from EHTs was approximately twice as long as APD80 in EBderived
cardiomyocytes. However, AP duration varied greatly
within the EHTs, ranging from 260 to 1200 ms. Cardiomyocytes
with longer APDs were characterized by greater AP upstroke
velocity. Maximal diastolic potentials were low in 2–3 week old EBs
(average 258.2 mV) and extended periods in EB format did not
lead to maturation (7–8 week old EBs: average 260.7 mV). The
maximal diastolic potential in EHTs was even less negative (average
249.1 mV) and this was consistent between the subpopulations
with different APDs. In all spontaneously beating hESC cultures,
exposure to nisoldipine (1 mM) completely interrupted electrical
activity as well as contractions, indicative of a crucial contribution of
transsarcolemmal calcium influx through L-type calcium channels
to spontaneous diastolic depolarization and AP generation (example
of hEHT shown in Figure S3). Application of the sodium channel
blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 3 mM) induced a significant decrease in
AP upstroke velocity, accompanied by a significant prolongation of
APD80 and diastolic interval (P,0.05, Student’s t-test, n=5 for each
parameter and hESC culture). The effects of TTX were particularly
pronounced in 7–8 week old EBs (Figure S3), suggesting that a
slowly inactivating component of the sodium current (referred to as
late INa) contributes to the AP firing in hESCs. Finally, exposure to
E-4031 (300 nM) induced a significant prolongation of APD in
hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (example of 7–8 week-old EBs
shown in Figure S3; P,0.05, Student’s t-test, n=4).

particularly low in EHT derived cardiomyocytes.

factor receptor alpha) and cardiac marker (ISL1, Islet-1, MYH6, a-myosin heavy chain, MYH7, ß-myosin heavy chain,) in EB-based cardiac differentiation

(Student’s t-test), bars show means 6 SD.
Pharmacology of hEHT
Calcium concentration-response curves showed that force
development in hEHT strongly depended on extracellular calcium
concentrations (Figure 4A, B). Lowering calcium from 1.8 mM
(baseline) to 0.2 mM decreased force by 90%. Cumulative
increases in calcium concentrations increased force until a plateau
was reached between 2.2 and 3.0 mM. In the presence of 0.6 mM
calcium the b-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (100 nM) had a
positive chronotropic effect, which was accompanied by a trend
towards an increase in force (not significant), both were reversed
by the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (10 mM, Figure 4B).
To determine the suitability of hEHT to detect proarrhythmic
effects of drugs, hEHT were exposed to the known proarrhythmic
compounds E-4031, procainamide, cisapride, quinidine, and
sertindole. Concentrations were chosen according to published
IC50 in hERG assays [23,24]. The antibiotic ampicillin served as
negative control. Proarrhythmic compounds led to a concentrationdependent
reduction in relaxation velocity, decline in contractile
force and irregular beating patterns (Figure 4, Table 2, information
S1). Maximal effects amounted to reductions by 30–50%. In
contrast, no concentration-dependent changes were monitored in
the presence of even high concentrations of ampicillin (1 mM). We
have shown previously that time and rate of relaxation were the
primary parameters affected by proarrhythmic compounds in rat
EHTs, likely as a surrogate of action potential duration [20]. Based
on these observations, the concentration of each respective
compound was determined that led to a significant decrease in
relaxation velocity in hEHTs. E-4031 is a potent and specific
inhibitor of IKr and, at 3 nM, led to an exclusive decrease of
relaxation velocity. This matches well with hERG channel assay
results (IC50 7 nM). At a higher concentration (30 nM) force of
contraction and contraction velocity declined significantly as well
(Table 2). Other proarrhythmic compounds are less specific hERG
channel blockers and additionally modulate sodium channels
(quinidine, procainamide), calcium channels (quinidine), adrenergic
(sertindole), cholinergic (quinidine), dopaminergic (sertindole) and
5-HT receptors (sertindole, cisapride). However, all compounds
decreased relaxation velocity at concentrations close to the reported
IC50 values in hERG channel assays (Table 2). Moreover, all
proarrhythmic compounds resulted in irregular beating patterns at
similar concentrations (Table 2, information S1).

Data are presented as means 6 SEM, with n representing the number of cells

APD was 500 ms. Student’s two-tailed paired or unpaired t-test as appropriate
was used to assess statistical significance versus EB (2–3 w), indicated by
*P,0.05 (Student’s t-test).
Discussion
In this manuscript we report a new method to generate 3D, forcegenerating
human heart muscles (hEHT) from hESC that are
amenable to automated drug screening in a 24-well format.
Important aspects are (1) the use of an unpurified population of
differentiated hESC with 40% cardiomyocytes, (2) the relative
simplicity of the protocol, (3) the high degree of 3D cardiac tissuelike
structure of hEHT, (4) the stability and regularity of
spontaneous beating for weeks allowing repeated measurements,
and (5) the high sensitivity towards proarrhythmic compounds. As
such the method may be useful for predictive toxicology.
Furthermore, it represents an important step towards iPS-mediated
disease modelling and, for the first time, opens a realistic
opportunity to study the effect of overexpressing or knocking down
proteins of interest in human cardiac muscle tissue.
One of the current limitations of hESC-derived cardiac myocytes
is their immature and unorganized phenotype in the EB format or
2D cultures [3,5]. Three ways were explored to analyze whether the
hEHT format improves maturation of cardiomyocytes. Histologically,
cardiomyocytes in EHTs showed substantially better
sarcomeric organisation and alignment than cardiomyocytes in
EBs and other published culture formats. Likely reasons are the
straight force lines imposed by spanning of the tissue between the
two silicone posts and the fact that hEHTs continuously perform
contractile work against the elastic posts as previously described in
neonatal rat EHTs [20]. Quantitative RT-PCR provided some
evidence that the EHT format is promoting maturation: Transcript
concentrations of b-MHC, the adult isoform in humans, increased
over time significantly only in EHT format but not in EB format,
similar to what has been described for the transition of immature to
adult human ventricular cardiomyocytes [25]. Somewhat in
contrast to these findings were the electrophysiological characteristics.
On the one hand, ventricular cardiomyocyte-like APD
supported maturation. On the other hand, hEHT-derived cardiomyocytes
showed slow upstroke velocities and low MDP. The latter
is a characteristic feature of hESC-derived cardiac myocytes and has
been explained by insufficient IK1 current [3]. It remains unclear
why cardiomyocytes isolated from EHTs had even lower MDPs
than those from EBs. Technical reasons (e.g. consequences of
enzymatic dissociation) or the fibrin matrix may be one factor, but
they cannot fully explain this finding since MDPs of cardiomyocytes
from neonatal rat EHTs amounted to 279 mV under similar
experimental conditions [20]. Thus, cardiac myocytes in hEHT,
despite excellent structural maturity, appear to be electrophysiologically
immature. This immaturity likely contributes to very
regular and stable beating over weeks, which differs from (the likely
more mature) rat EHTs. The non-myocyte content in EHTs was
analyzed and revealed that the contribution of derivatives of
neuroectodermal and endodermal as well as other mesodermal
lineages (hematopoietic, endothelial, mesodermal somite) was very
small after cardiac differentiation and EHT generation. The strong
upregulation of ACTA2 transcripts and the immunofluorescent
staining of vimentin-positive cells in the EHTs indicate that
(myo)fibroblast was the predominant non-myocyte subpopulation.
Our automated analysis system is based on video-optical
recordings of spontaneously beating hEHTs. Thus, drug effects
by definition are restricted to affections of contractile pattern. The
parameters are frequency of contraction (bpm), force of contraction
(mN), times of contraction/relaxation (ms), maximal velocity
of contraction/relaxation (dF/dt, mN/sec) and onset of irregular
beating pattern. All parameters were analyzed in the presence of
increasing concentrations of extracellular calcium, isoprenaline 6
carbachol or proarrhythmic compounds. Experiments with
calcium, isoprenaline and carbachol demonstrated that hEHT
responded to standard inotropic interventions similar to human
heart muscle. Importantly, the calcium-response curve was in a
relatively normal range (maximal effect reached at 3 mM), in this
respect they differ from rat EHT which respond to unusually low
calcium concentrations and reach their maximum at 1.6 mM
[16]. The responses to isoprenaline and carbachol, albeit relatively
small in size compared to adult human heart, indicate the
principal existence of an adrenergic and muscarinic receptor
system.

Table 2. Comparison of threshold concentrations.
Comparison of the threshold concentrations at which the compounds
significantly decreased relaxation velocity (P,0.05 vs baseline, Student t-test) or
induced irregular beating patterns (RR-scatter, P,0.05 vs baseline, Mann-
Whitney U Test) with published IC50 values in hERG channel assays [24][23]. RRscatter
was defined as the interdecile range of beat-to-beat interval length
(information S1).
Experiments with the specific IKr blocker E-4031 and several
other compounds, which share hERG blockade and proarrhythmic
effects in humans as a common feature, showed significant
decreases in repolarisation velocity and the occurrence of irregular
beating pattern (scatter of beat-to-beat variability). Threshold
concentrations for these parameters compare well with published
IC50 values determined in hERG channel assays. This suggests
that these two parameters are the best surrogate of hERG
inhibition and proarrhythmic potential in hEHTs. Interestingly,
the antipsychotic drug sertindole prolonged relaxation at the
hERG concentration of 10 nM, but induced significant beat-tobeat
variability only at a 30-fold higher concentration. The exact
reason is presently unknown, but likely pharmacological properties
in addition to hERG-inhibition account for it and can only be
distinguished by studying larger panels of indicator compounds.
High concentrations of proarrhythmic compounds led to a decline
in force of spontaneous contractions. This is likely the consequence
of repolarisation inhibition (IKr block) on top of insufficient IK1
current, resulting in a reversible depolarisation block. In this
context the decrease in contractile force can not be interpreted as a
typical negative inotropic effect as exerted for example by L-type
calcium channel blockers. In addition the expected positive
inotropic effect of repolarisation inhibitors (by prolongation of
plateau phase and concomitant increase in calcium influx) is
masked in this system, possibly because maximal force development
is already almost reached at the standard calcium
concentration in the medium of 2 mM (see Figure 4A).
Compared to patch clamp experiments, video-optical recordings
and analysis of hEHTs are simple and require only
adjustment of XYZ-coordinates of the camera for each hEHT.
Recording of movies, figure recognition, analysis of contractility,
graphical presentation and calculation of averaged contraction
parameters are determined in an automated mode. Importantly
and in contrast to most other assays, this test system utilizes human
cardiomyocytes and thus integrates the complexity of this human
cell type, moreover in a 3D tissue structure. HEHTs can be used
repeatedly after over night wash-out periods.
A number of limitations of this protocol need to be stated. The
first one relates to the still limited number of differentiated
cardiomyocytes from hESC and their immaturity. The differentiation
protocol is time consuming and requires continuous
monitoring. It is working well with the hES2 cell line, but has not
been optimized for other hESC or human iPS cell lines yet. At
present, 2–4 EHTs can be generated per differentiation of 100 cm2
of undifferentiated hESCs, which translates into approximately 50
J per hEHT for media and supplements. An important reason is
the low cardiomyocytes/input of undifferentiated hESC-ratio
(0.04/1) which is inferior to ratios of other published statagies: 3/
1 [5] 0.8/1 [6]. EHT-derived cardiomyocytes have significantly
lower maximal diastolic potentials than ventricular cardiomyocytes
and can therefore not be considered as an in vitro model of mature
myocardium. Recent studies have highlighted the role of NRG-1ß/
Erbß signalling in the specification of cardiomyocytes subtypes of
differentiating hESCs [26] and might therefore be useful in the
process of maturation. The second limitation is the lack of direct
measurements of APD and/or calcium transients. We are currently
setting up a suitable recording system which aims at monitoring of
calcium transients (and APs) with fluorescent dyes and also allows
for electrical pacing and continuous perfusion. Finally, the true
predictive value of this method for toxicology studies in addition or
as an alternative to current tests needs to be assessed with larger
series of known proarrhythmic and safe drugs.
Overall hEHTs show important features of human myocardium,
recapitulate findings in conventional toxicity tests and might
be a useful in vitro surrogate in the context of predictive toxicology,
drug development and disease modelling.
Materials and Methods
Culturing undifferentiated hESC
HES2 cells (HES2.R26 [27]) were propagated on MatrigelH
with CF1-MEF conditioned medium according to published
protocols [28].
Cardiomyocytes differentiation
Confluent layers of hESC colonies were digested with
collagenase IV (Gibco 17104, 1 mg/ml, 1 ml/10 cm2) until edges
of the colonies start to dislodge (10–20 minutes). Collagenase was
removed and washed with 2 ml PBS/10 cm2. CF1-MEF conditioned
medium was added (1 ml/10 cm2). Embryoid bodies (EBs)
were generated by carefully scraping off colony fragments with a
5 ml-pipette tip. Colony fragments were collected and remaining
colonies were detached with a cell scraper. EB formation was
performed in ultra low attachment cell culture flasks (ULA-CCF,
Corning 3815), with colony fragments of 2.5 cm2 (undifferentiated
hESC layer) per ml conditioned medium. Differentiation was
performed in RPMI-B27 medium containing RPMI 1640 (Gibco
21875), B-27 supplement (2%, Gibco 0080085-SA), Penicillin/
Streptomycin (0.5%, Gibco 15140) and HEPES (10 mM). Y-
27632 (10 mM, Biaffin PKI-27632-010) and growth factors were
added as specified (Figure S1).
After 24 hours EBs were collected in 50 ml tubes. ULA-CCFs
were washed twice with PBS, solutions were added to the tubes
and centrifuged (4 minutes, 300 rpm). Pelleted EBs were resuspendend
in 20 ml mesodermal induction medium (stage I, basic
FGF (5 ng/ml, R&D 233-FB), Activin-A (6 ng/ml, R&D 338-
AC), BMP-4 (10 ng/ml, R&D 314-BP), Y-27632 (10 mM)) and
transferred back into the ULA-CCF. After 1–3 days EBs were
collected in 50 ml tubes. ULA-CCFs were washed twice with PBS,
solutions were added to the tubes and centrifuged (4 minutes,
300 rpm). EBs were resuspendend in 15 ml cardiomyocyte
induction medium (stage II, DKK-1 (150 ng/ml, R&D 5439-
DK), VEGF (10 ng/ml, R&D 293-VE), Y-27632 (10 mM) and
transferred back into the ULA-CCF. After 3 days EBs were
collected in 50 ml tubes. ULA-CCFs were washed twice with PBS,
solutions were added to the tubes and centrifuged (4 minutes,
300 rpm). EBs were resuspendend in 15 ml cardiomyocyte
induction medium (stage III, DKK-1 (150 ng/ml), VEGF
(10 ng/ml), basic FGF (5 ng/ml)). After 5–7 days 5 ml of
RPMI-B27 medium was added every second day until the first
beating EBs were detected. EB formation and differentiation was
performed at 95% humidity, 37uC, 5% oxygen, 5% CO2. EBs
were transferred to serum-containing medium (DMEM, Gibco
41965, 1% L-glutamine, 1% NEAA, 0.5% Penicillin/Streptomycin,
20% fetal bovine serum, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) between
day 12–15 and were kept at 20% oxygen. Analysis of contractility
and dissociation for EHT generation was performed around day
15–20 (Movie S1).
Total RNA preparation and quantification of gene
expression
Total RNA was prepared with Qiagen RNeasy according to
manufacturer’s instructions. For reverse transcription and quantitative
RT-PCR the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems) and POWER SYBRH Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Experiments were performed on an ABI PRISM
7900HT Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Quantification
was performed by determining DDCT analysis using
glucoronidase (GUSB) as a housekeeping gene and undifferentiated
hESCs as reference. PCR products were verified by amplicon size in
agarose gels and melting curve analysis. Primer sequences are listed
in Table S1.
EHT generation
EBs were dissociated with 500 ml of a pre-warmed mixture
(37uC) of collagenase and trypsin (approximately 1 mg/ml
collagenase in 0.5% trypsin solution) for 2–5 minutes under
continuous trituration with a 100 ml pipette. Dissociated cells were
washed twice by adding 1 ml of serum containing media and
centrifugation for 2 min at 200 g. After cell counting human
EHTs were generated according to a protocol recently described
for neonatal rat cardiomyocytes [20]. 0.66106 differentiated cells
were used per EHT (100 mL). Human EHTs were maintained
under cell culture conditions (37uC, 95% humidity, 40% oxygen)
and medium was changed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Medium composition was: DMEM (Biochrom F0415), 10% horse
serum (Gibco 26050), 2% chick embryo extract, 1%, penicillin/
streptomycin (Gibco 15140), insulin (10 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich
I9278), tranexamic acid (400 mM, Sigma-Aldrich 857653) and
aprotinin (33 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich A1153). Y-27632 (10 mM)
was added to the medium for the first 24 hours. Silicone racks
were custom made by Ja¨ ger Gummi und Kunststoff GmbH and
Siltec GmbH. EHTs were subjected to further analysis after 5
weeks, thus matching the age of 7–8 week old EBs.
FACS analysis
Embryoid bodies were harvested and dissociated into single cells
as described above. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD
Cytofix/CytopermTM solution (BD Biosciences 554722) for intracellular
FACS, then incubated in blocking solution (TBS 0.05 M,
pH 7.4, 10% FCS, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100). Staining was
performed with anti-a-actinin (Sigma-Aldrich A7811, 1:800) as
primary antibody and Alexa fluorH 488 (goat anti-mouse 2 mg/ml,
Molecular Probes A11017, 1:400) as secondary antibody in
antibody solution (TBS 0.05 M, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton
X-100). Negative control was performed without primary antibody.
Data were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer and
analyzed using BD FACSDiva Software 6.0 (BD Biosciences).
Action potential measurements
Action potentials (APs) were recorded from cells in spontaneously
beating, partially dissociated EB cell clusters and EHTs with
the conventional intracellular recording technique in the zero
current clamp mode. All experiments were carried out at 35–37uC
in serum-free DMEM (containing the following inorganic salts in
mM: 110 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.9 NaH2PO4, 0.8 MgSO4, 1.4 CaCl2,
44 NaHCO3) continuously gassed with carbogen to provide
oxygenation and a pH of 7.4–7.6. The sharp microelectrodes had
tip resistances ranging from 15 to 20 MV when filled with 3 M
KCl. The pipette offset was compensated; the junction potential
(1–2 mV) was negligible. About 20 hours before measurement, the
EHTs were exposed to chymotrypsin (0.0025%, Sigma-Aldrich
C4129) and collagenase CLS type II (0.2 mg/ml (65 units/ml);
Worthington NY 4176) for 30 minutes to facilitate impalement of
the muscle cells within the fibrin matrix. Data acquisition and
analysis was achieved by the use of an EPC-9 patch clamp
amplifier in combination with the Pulse/PulseFit 8.11 software
(HEKA, Lamprecht, Germany). Output signals were digitized at
1 kHz. The following parameters were measured: AP duration at
80% repolarization (APD80) and AP amplitude (APA), maximum
AP upstroke velocity (dV/dtmax), and maximum diastolic potential
(MDP). The pharmacological agents used in the electrophysiological
studies included E-4031 (Eisai, Tokyo, Japan), tetrodotoxin
(TTX, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and the L-type calcium
channel inhibitor nisoldipine (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany) at
final concentrations of 0.3, 3 and 1 mmol/L, respectively.
Concentration-response curves for calcium and proarrhythmic
drugs
Calcium-concentration response curves were established in
DMEM, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, and
100 mM acetylcysteine with calcium concentrations adjusted to the
desired final concentration (0.2–3.0 mmol/L). Equilibration time
was 20 minutes. Measurements were performed under spontaneous
activity by automated video-optical recording and analysis (customized
software, Consulting Team Machine Vision) as previously
described [20]. Contractile force F was calculated from the degree of
post deflection d (mm), silicone post length (L) and radius (R) and
elastic modulus (E) by the formula F=3pER4d/4L3 [29]. Contraction-
and relaxation velocities were calculated as the average
maximal steepness of twitch contraction or relaxation, respectively.
Each value represents the mean of all measurable contraction
twitches in the recording period of 60 seconds per hEHT.
Human EHTs exhibiting well detectable spontaneous post
deflections were subjected to measurement of proarrhythmic
drugs. EHTs were equilibrated in DMEM, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM acetylcysteine for one
hour. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO (E-4031, quinidine,
procainamide, sertindole, cisapride, ampicillin) and added to the
EHTs at cumulative concentrations 30 min before measurement.
Isoprenaline and carbachol were used at 100 nM and 10 mM,
respectively.
Immunofluorescence
EBs/EHTs were fixed in 4% formalin over night. Blocking,
antibody incubation and washing steps were performed with whole
mount samples for 24 hours each. Antibodies and solutions were
used as follows: a-actinin (Sigma A7811, 1:800), connexin-43 (BD
610061, 1:250), DRAQ5 (Biostatus BOS-889-001-R050, 1:1000),
vimentin (R&D MAB2105, 1:50), phalloidin (Invitrogen A-12379,
1:60), secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse AlexaH488 (Invitrogen
A-11017, 1:800), goat-anti-mouse AlexaH546 (Invitrogen A-
11003, 1:800), goat anti-rat (R&D NL013, 1:200). Confocal laser
scanning microscopy was performed with Zeiss LSM 510 META
system.
Alignment quantification
To calculate alignment of cardiomyocytes in the EB- and EHTformat,
a total number of 17 randomly chosen pictures (11 EHT, 6
EB) showing immunofluorescence staining of sarcomeric proteins (aactinin,
cTNT, phalloidin) was analyzed. Orientations (angles) of 10 to
20 prominent sarcomeric structures per picture were measured by four
experimentators and dispersion of angles was calculated as interquartile
range. Dispersion was expressed as percent (90uo100%o1).
The alignment score was defined as the inverse value of relative angle
dispersion [10]. Statistical difference were determined with *P,0.05
(Student’s t-test). An averge angle dispersion of 9u (10%, 0.1) would
result in an alignment value of 10.
Statistics
Intervals between two contractions were determined for all
recordings. The interval lengths of a single recording did not fulfil
requirements of a normal distribution. Interval scatter was therefore
defined as the length between 10th and 90th percentile (interdecile
range, IDR). Statistical difference between groups of biological
replicas were determined with Mann-Whitney U Test (*P,0.05).
